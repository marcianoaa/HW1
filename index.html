        <h1>Welcome to Chokers By Ang!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
            <p>My name is Angelena Marciano and I am the business owner and founder of Chokers By Ang. I want to introduce my business to you all and give Chokers By Ang a bit of personality. I started Chokers By Ang in attempt to turn my simple idea and talent into something great that many people can enjoy.
                <br> <br>
            Choker necklaces have always been a jewelry piece I found to be pretty and timeless. I design my chokers with a bohemian yet simplistic feel. I think a dainty, minimalist necklace is a staple in every woman's closet.
        </p>

        <h2>Where it All Began </h2>
        <p> It started off as a simple idea that popped into my head in the summer of 2016, while binge-watching “Grey’s Anatomy” in bed like I did every morning. Choker necklaces were making a come-back and becoming the "hip new trend", again. “I should start a business,” I thought to myself. But with the limited budget of a college student, I found myself at a standstill. I was confident that I could somehow utilize my creative mind and artistic abilities to make a profit. Determined to make my dream a success, I headed on over to Michael’s Arts and Crafts store to pick up all the essentials of jewelry making. And that marked the official start of “Chokers by Ang. </p>

        <h2>Where it is Now</h2>

        <p>Today, Chokers By Ang feels like it is a part of me. All of my necklaces are handmade by me (usually still while watching Grey's Anatomy), enabling a personal connection to each and every necklace I make. I like to keep my work environment lightweight and fun, but this doesn't mean I don't put my 100% into my products. Over the years, I have  grown very fond of Chokers By Ang and take great care in the quality of my products and my customers' satisfaction. I have had nearly 200 sales on Etsy alone, but the best feeling is still when a customer leaves a 5 star review and I know they were satisfied with my work. </p>

            <p> As an artist and designer, it is exciting to display your work and receive feedback from the public eye. I would really like to use this website as an opportunity to express my artwork in a more public setting and, hopefully, as an inspiration to others. </p>

            <p> I hope that my website to be able to assist anyone who is interested in jewelry design, or anyone who would like to run a business that includes selling their original work. </p>
